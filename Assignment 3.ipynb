    "# Assignment 3: Motion AutoEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will implement and train an autoencoder for motion generation using the CMU-Mocap dataset. You will develop a simplified version of a motion manifold system capable of learning from motion capture data, synthesizing new movements, and enabling basic motion editing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read the following two papers as they are your reference for your implementation:\n",
    "* Learning Motion Manifolds with Convolutional Autoencoders, https://www.ipab.inf.ed.ac.uk/cgvu/motioncnn.pdf\n",
    "* A Deep Learning Framework for Character Motion Synthesis and Editing, https://www.ipab.inf.ed.ac.uk/cgvu/motionsynthesis.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you understand motion data representation, here are some valuable resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CMU Mocap dataset**: https://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/\n",
    "  * The raw data format may be challenging to interpret directly. For easier use, download the BVH format (which our dataloader utilizes): https://github.com/una-dinosauria/cmu-mocap\n",
    "  * Blender (https://www.blender.org/) can be used to visualize the downloaded BVH files. This will provide a clearer understanding of the human skeleton structure used in the dataset and allow you to visualize the raw motion sequences.\n",
    "* **Additional reference** (optional): For a deeper exploration of human models, you can examine more motion data in FBX format at: https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&type=Motion%2CMotionPack\n",
    "  * Note that Mixamo uses a different skeletal structure than our dataset, but it includes human mesh deformation with motion, which BVH data doesn't provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment includes substantial starter code in separate Python files to help you get started. Your tasks are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete all sections marked with `TODO` comments. Feel free to add code or restructure functions to improve your implementation's flexibility during training.\n",
    "* Present your results by embedding videos and images in this notebook. You should also answer all questions and complete the write-up sections in this notebook.\n",
    "* Include all necessary video files, images, and code files in your submission for proper evaluation. **Important**: Do NOT submit model checkpoints as these will unnecessarily increase your submission size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please reserve enough time for this assignment given the potential amount of time for training.**"

    "\n",
    "Unlike previous assignments where standard dataloaders were readily available in existing libraries, this assignment requires implementing a custom dataloader for the CMU-Mocap dataset.\n",

    "We've provided most of the dataloader implementation in `dataloader.py` and included a pre-processed version of the necessary data in `cmu-mocap/cache` (https://utexas.box.com/v/cmu-mocap-cache). Please download this data and place the `cmu-mocap` folder in your current working directory. Alternatively, you can download the BVH files from the links provided earlier and generate your own pre-processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part, you need to implement data normalization in the dataloader. There are two sets of TODOs in the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, compute appropriate statistics for normalizing your data based on the entire dataset\n",
    "2. Second, implement the normalization procedure in the `__getitem__` function where the dataloader retrieves one batch of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon successful completion of this section, you should be able to visualize four sample motion sequences by running `python dataloader.py`.\n",

    "Important notes:\n",

    "1. The reference paper was published several years ago when neural network implementations were often manually coded with custom operations. You'll need to adapt these concepts to modern PyTorch conventions and standard operations. Some training parameters may require adjustment to work effectively with contemporary deep learning frameworks.\n",
